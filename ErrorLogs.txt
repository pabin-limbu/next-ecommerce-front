ERROR 1:
    The stye that we were applying was actually not shown because he havent added styledComponents: true, in our next.config file.
LOG 1: Please do not use @import CSS syntax in createGlobalStyle at this time, as the CSSOM APIs we use in production do not handle it well.
       Instead, we recommend using a library such as react-helmet to inject a typical <link> meta tag to the stylesheet, or simply embedding
       it manually in your index.html <head> section for a simpler app.    
fix 1:
    add styledComponents: true, in nex.config file.
    eg: 
    const nextConfig = {
        reactStrictMode: true,
        compiler: {
            styledComponents: true,
             },
        };

ERROR 2: Failed to load props returned from getServersideProps to component.
FIX 2 : props are supposed to be sent as string or json. The data fetched from database is a database object so it need to be converted back to json.

ERROR 3: receiveing true for non boolean attribute.
FIX 3: we can send propsName = {1} if boolean parameter are not accepted as 1 represent true at the receiveing end.
